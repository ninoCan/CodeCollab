Welcome to Code Collab!;

This is a repository dedicated to coding exercises aimed at improving software engineering skills and promoting best practices.
Whether you're a beginner looking to sharpen your skills or an experienced developer seeking to deepen your understanding,
you'll find a variety of exercises here to challenge and inspire you.



## How this works


Exercises in Code Collab follows a structured approach combining Katas and Koans:

- **Refactoring Task**:
You'll be presented with a specific refactoring task aimed at improving code quality and promoting best practices.
- **Kata Test Suite**:
A set of unit tests ensures that the initial code snippet to be refactored is already tested and in a green state,
serving as a safety net for your refactorings.
- **Koan Test Suite**: Another set of unit tests starts in a red state, representing the desired outcome of the refactoring task.
Your goal is to refactor the code until all tests in this suite turn green.

Our exercises are available in multiple languages, including:
 - [Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python/),
 - [Scala](https://github.com/lauris/awesome-scala/),
 - [Rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust/),
 - [Java](https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java),
 - [TypeScript](https://github.com/semlinker/awesome-typescript/).
